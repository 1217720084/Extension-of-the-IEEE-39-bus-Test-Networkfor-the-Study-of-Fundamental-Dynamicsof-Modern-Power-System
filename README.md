## Real-time simulator 
We use the Opal-RT real-time digital simulator OP5600, coupled with the eMEGAsim PowerGrid running on the RT-LAB real-time simulation platform. For installation, user guide and more information of the real-time simulator go [here](https://www.opal-rt.com/).
## Software 
The following software is required to run the model:
* MATLAB Version 8.5.1 (R2015aSP1)   
* Simulink Version 8.5.1 (R2015aSP1)   
* ARTEMIS Blockset Version 7.2.2.1206 (R2015a)   
* RT-LAB Version v11.2.2.108 (R2015a.x), available [here](https://www.opal-rt.com/)
